				<h1> Background Research</h1>
       <p>For my project, I want to showcase unique and interesting cuisines of different cultures. Many times people will be able to detect what type of cuisine they are smelling or eating but they do not know the key ingredients that make the food unique to that region. I want people to be able to learn how to cook great food and be inspired by ingredients that are found all around the world and used in ways that one may not expect.
       </p>
       <h3> What Are the Defining Ingredients of a Cultureâ€™s Cuisine?</h3>
			 <p>This article speaks about statistics that were found after conducting a survey of different labeled cuisines on the site Epicurious. It is interesting because they tracked ingredients that were unique to the recipe as well as the most common ingredient. In both results, it was not always a match of ingredients. They state that although it can be hard to define a cuisine, we can try to classify them to learn more about the importance of those ingredients from the regions that they are used in. </p>
       <h3> The Changing Global Diet</h3>
			 <p>This article shows data that had been collected over the past 50 years and reveals how diets and changes in food have taken place from countries around the world. I find that one of the most important findings is that cuisines around the world have become more similar over the years. I think this is because of the smaller world we have today with the greater accessibility of different ingredients. New and interesting ingredients are being introduced to different places all the time to spread knowledge of other cultures and share different experiences. </p>
       <h3> National Cuisines: What Ingredients Make Dishes from Different Cultures Distinctive?</h3>
			 <p>In the 3rd article, which is another analysis of the first article, the author talks about the importance of these statistics and what we can learn from them. We can see that the common ingredients listed are often the stereotypical ones, such as sauerkraut for Germany. It is interesting to see common ingredients per cuisine because that is how we can categorize and distinguish one from the other. </p>
       <p>I want to incorporate the information about these ingredients and tie them into recipes that are specific to certain countries and perhaps some fusions as well to mix flavors in a new and exciting way.</p>
