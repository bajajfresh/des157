				<h1> Audience Research</h1>
       <p>For my project, I decided to focus on the topic of food. I want to create an interactive that can show users where different ingredients come from and recipes to cook local cuisines from that region. My audience ranges from different age groups and is applicable to all that love food.</p>

			 <p>Meet Chrissy Teigen. She is a 30-something mother of a beautiful toddler daughter and her second child on the way. She is a foodie and prides herself on trying and creating new recipes. She spends her time looking after her daughter and sharing her food adventures with the world on social media. She has her own cooking book that explores different flavors.</p>
       <p>She is not short of money, but that doesn't matter much because she cares about adventures and experiences. She lives in Los Angeles and is exposed to many different cuisines. She would use this interactive to explore new ingredients that she can utilize in her recipes.</p>
