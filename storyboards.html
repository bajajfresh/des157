			 <p>After the first drawing of my storyboard, the feedback that I received was generally good. Nandini said that she understood the concept of my idea and that it was similar to hers. My application/website provides recipes from different cuisines and gives a suggestion on where to find different or uncommon ingredients.</p>
       <p>The second iteration of my storyboard names an uncommon ingredient such as tamarind. The user is unfamiliar with that ingredient, but luckily, the application has information for him to read about how tamarind tastes and its common uses. He then looks for where he can buy tamarind for the recipe. My second peer feedback was better, as my storyboard became more real and clear.</p>
