				<h1> Project Brief</h1>
				<h3> Topic Summary</h3>
       <p>For my project, I want to showcase unique and interesting cuisines of different cultures. Many times people will be able to detect what type of cuisine they are smelling or eating but they do not know the key ingredients that make the food unique to that region. I want people to be able to learn how to cook great food and be inspired by ingredients that are found all around the world and used in ways that one may not expect.
       </p>
			 <p>It seems that a majority of people are unfamiliar with the ingredients that are in the different cuisines that they love because they haven't had a chance to explore them or cook the meals themselves. With a better understanding of why the food tastes the way it does, they can appreciate the food more and the way that it was prepared.
       </p>
       <h3> Target Audience</h3>
			 <p>The target audience for my project are foodies. Foodies from ranging ages that love to explore different cultures. They would like to spend their time cooking and preparing their meals from scratch. It is more ideal for people willing to find ingredients they need to cook rather than buying their meal from a restaurant. This group is not lazy, they love to be in the kitchen and follow many different foodie blogs or instagrams.</p>
       <h3> The Goals of the Project</h3>
			 <p>The project will allow the user to find recipes of different cuisines and instructions on how to prepare them. It would highlight certain special ingredients that would seem a bit uncommon. Users can see a flavor profile of that ingredient and perhaps find an alternative spice or flavor that can substitute it. The ingredients would hopefully allow the user to find locations that the ingredient can be found such as local stores or online sources.  </p>
       <h3> Communication Strategy</h3>
			 <p>I would like to use basic information to communicate with the users about the ingredients. They may not necessarily have the knowledge or background for complex information. Furthermore, we want to encourage the exploration of these ingredients and not make the recipes seem too complicated even if they seem like they are.I want to incorporate the information about these ingredients and tie them into recipes that are specific to certain countries and perhaps some fusions as well to mix flavors in a new and exciting way.</p>
			 <h3> Goals for the Visual Look and Feel</h3>
			<p>I would want my project to have colorful elements against a white background. I find that this scheme of colors is most effective to give an exciting feel to the application. When users see colors against white it gives a clean and modern feel to the application. I want the users to feel excited to try something new and feel like they will cook up something awesome. </p>
